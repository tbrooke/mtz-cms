## Notes & Observations

(Add notes as you go)

## Progress Update - 2025-10-01 09:23

### Phase 3: File Extraction - ✅ COMPLETE!
- ✅ Created: src/mtz_cms/ui/styles.clj (tested, committed)
- ✅ Created: src/mtz_cms/components/primitives.clj (tested, committed)
- ✅ Created: src/mtz_cms/components/navigation.clj (tested, committed)

**Note**: Navigation tested without Alfresco connection (no children yet - expected)

**Next**: Update ui/components.clj to re-export from new namespaces

## Live App Testing - 2025-10-01 14:01

### ✅ LIVE APP TESTING COMPLETE - SUCCESS!

**Test Results**:
- ✅ App starts without errors (using clj -M:dev)
- ✅ Home page loads
- ✅ Menu works great
- ✅ Alfresco content is present
- ⚠️ Some styling issues noted (defer to later)

**Refactoring Validated**:
- Backward compatibility maintained
- No broken functionality
- Clean separation of concerns achieved
- 300+ lines → focused namespaces

**Styling Issues**: 
- Noted but acceptable for now
- Focus was on architecture, not styling
- Can be addressed in future iteration

### Major Milestone Achieved! 🎉

**What We Accomplished**:
1. Deleted 899 lines of redundant code
2. Split ui/components.clj (300+ lines) into:
   - ui/styles.clj (20 lines)
   - components/primitives.clj (60 lines)
   - components/navigation.clj (100 lines)
   - ui/components.clj (76 lines re-exports)
3. Maintained 100% backward compatibility
4. Live app runs successfully
5. All commits clean and logical

**Branch Status**: refactor-components-2025 (ready to merge)

### Phase 5: Layout Reorganization - ✅ COMPLETE!

**What We Did**:
1. Created new `src/mtz_cms/layouts/` directory
2. Moved `components/layouts.clj` → `layouts/templates.clj`
3. Updated import in `ui/pages.clj` from:
   - `[mtz-cms.components.layouts :as layouts]`
   - → `[mtz-cms.layouts.templates :as layouts]`
4. Deleted old `components/layouts.clj`
5. Verified no other files reference the old namespace

**Files Changed**:
- ✅ Created: `src/mtz_cms/layouts/templates.clj` (135 lines)
- ✅ Updated: `src/mtz_cms/ui/pages.clj` (import only)
- ✅ Deleted: `src/mtz_cms/components/layouts.clj`

**Architectural Improvement**:
- Layouts now have their own top-level namespace
- Clearer separation: `layouts/*` for page composition vs `components/*` for reusable pieces
- Maintains dependency on `components/templates.clj` for rendering logic

**Testing Status**:
- File syntax validated
- Import updated successfully
- Ready for live app testing

**Next Steps**:
1. Test in live application
2. Commit changes
3. Move to Phase 6: Component Registry

## Architecture Notes

### New Structure After Phase 5:

```
src/mtz_cms/
├── layouts/
│   └── templates.clj          ← NEW! Page composition
├── components/
│   ├── navigation.clj         ← Extracted from ui/components
│   ├── primitives.clj         ← Extracted from ui/components
│   └── templates.clj          ← Component templates (render-hero, etc)
└── ui/
    ├── components.clj         ← Re-exports only
    ├── styles.clj             ← Extracted CSS/Tailwind
    └── pages.clj              ← Uses layouts/*
```

### Benefits of This Change:
1. **Clear Separation**: 
   - `layouts/*` = page structure/composition
   - `components/*` = reusable pieces
2. **Better Organization**: Layouts are first-class citizens
3. **Easier to Understand**: New devs can find layouts quickly
4. **Future-Ready**: Room to add more layout strategies

### Potential Concerns:
⚠️ The layout registry (`available-layouts` def) might be overengineering if:
   - It's not actively used by Alfresco
   - No dynamic layout selection happens
   - Consider removing if unused after Phase 8 testing

✅ Good decision to keep `templates.clj` dependency - it provides:
   - `render-hero`, `render-feature`, `feature-card`
   - Actual rendering logic separate from layout structure
